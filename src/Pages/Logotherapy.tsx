                            Logotherapy, derived from the Greek word "logos" meaning "meaning," is a therapeutic approach
                            that focuses on helping individuals discover and pursue their unique life purpose. Developed by
                            Dr. Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, this method is based on the belief
                            that our primary drive is not pleasure or power, but the search for meaning.

                            Unlike traditional therapies that focus primarily on symptom relief, logotherapy helps people
                            find meaning in their experiences, including suffering, and empowers them to choose their
                            attitude toward life's challenges. This approach often leads to deeper, more lasting change
                            and a greater sense of fulfillment.
