Through her thoughtful, compassionate approach and the depth of logotherapy, I not only found clarity but also felt inspired to study the method myself. As a teacher, she brings a rare combination of deep knowledge, extensive experience, and a life journey that enriches everything she shares. Aviva's understanding isn’t just academic, it’s lived and felt. She teaches with humility, generosity, and a commitment to helping others grow. The tools and insights I’ve gained continue to guide me, both personally and professionally. I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to learn from her.",

    text: "Working with my logotherapy coach Aviva has been a truly transformative experience. I came in feeling overwhelmed by family-related frustrations that had been building for years. Through our sessions, I not only found clarity, but I also discovered a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in how I respond to challenges within my family. Instead of feeling stuck or reactive, I now feel grounded and more in control of how I show up — both emotionally and mentally. Aviva created a compassionate, judgment-free space where I felt safe to unpack complex emotions, while challenging me to look within. With her guidance, I learned how to shift my focus from what I couldn’t control to what I could: my mindset, my values, and my choices. Thanks to Aviva, I now feel empowered, more at peace, and better equipped to navigate the ups and downs of family life with strength and intention. I’m deeply grateful for the support and insight my coach offered—this journey has been life-changing.",

    text: `Aviva really gets me. She’s helped me understand people and what they mean, make friends, and find ways to calm down when everything feels too much. She’s given me tools to deal with Autism and ADHD, and to survive the hard parts of being a teenager. She’s been there for me through my darkest moments — self-harm, depression, and thoughts of ending my life — and she’s helped me understand my feelings instead of being scared of them. Because of her, I believe I can handle whatever comes next.`,
